## About Athena II
Athena II is a follow-up model rocket to a project I conducted during my undergraduate education. The goal of the original Athena project was to duplicate the success that [BPS.space](https://www.youtube.com/@BPSspace) was having with thrust-vectoring model rockets, albeit with my own designs. Athena II aims to build upon Athena's successes and failures with the goal of establishing an open source, freely available "smart" model rocket platform.

Since my experience with Athena, I have learned a lot about a variety of engineering disciplines through a few research projects, a master's degree, and employment at an aerospace company. My desire is for this project to demonstrate what I've learned and provide new opportunities to expand my aerospace education. While this is primarily a personal endeavor, I hope that this repository will serve as an educational hub for students and hobbiests who want to learn about the ins and outs of designing, building, and flying a complex aerospace system.

Some of the topics this project tackles include:
* Aerodynamics
* Propulsion
* Control systems
* Microcontrollers
* Systems engineering
* Model-based systems engineering (MBSE)
* Communications
* Flight software
* Verification and validation
* 3D printing

This list is certainly not exhaustive, and I encourage readers to explore this repo and its documentation for topics of additional interest.
